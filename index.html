    <h2>About the Consortium</h2>
    <p>
        We are at the early stages of seeing how generative AI will affect management, organizations, industries, and society.
        The impacts of generative AI on management have already proven to be wide ranging and dramatic.
        We realize that generative AI is proving to be a significant opportunity for students at all stages of their doctoral careers.
        We hope to create a community of faculty and doctoral students across disclinpes who are passionate about studying generative AI.
        During our time together, we hope that students have the opportunity to develop their ideas and research, get to know faculty across different universities, and meet fellow doctoral students.
    </p>

    <h2>Who should apply?</h2>
    <p>
        We welcome students doing research on generative AI across disciplines, including: accounting and finance, economics, information systems, marketing, operations, organizational behavior, and strategy and entrepreneurship. We also welcome researchers from diverse methodological traditions, including (but not limited to) qualitative, quantitative, experimental, and theoretical.
    </p>

    <p>
        We further invite doctoral students at all stages to apply for the consortium.
    </p>

    <p>
        <li>If you are in your first three years of your doctoral program, we invite you to submit a new project proposal or extended abstract of an existing project. You will have the opportunity to get feedback on your idea from faculty and other participants.</li>
        <li>If you are in your fourth year or later, we invite you to submit a paper to present at the consortium. The time allotted for each presentation is to be determined, but is expected to be between 14 and 18 minutes.</li>
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note, that if your research is purely technical in nature, we would likely not accept the submission. We are looking for students whose work is relevant in some way to research being performed at business schools. If you have any questions or are unsure about applying for any reason, please reach out to Anil Doshi who can provide feedback and responses to your questions.
    </p>
